## [1.1] 2022-10-21
### Added
- Optional configuration `pulse_timing` that can be set to control the speed of the `effect`.
- Optional configuration `repeatable` that will allow a button to be pressed and the command to be repeatedly sent.


### Changed
- Altered the color change animations when pressing the buttons.  The button will hold the color on a toggle to be more natural feeling.
